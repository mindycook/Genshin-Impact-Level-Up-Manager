A brief text file (README.md). The purpose of this text file is to help me run your code. Think of this 
like a how-to description of which functions/scripts I  need to run in order  to test your project. While 
you are free to organize this file as you see fit, I recommend including (at a minimum) a bulleted list 
with a short description of each code file and its purpose. 


- giman.py
    - main executable file
    - to start, enter a name
        - if you dont know what name to put, enter "whomst"

    - produces two files when run
        -converted_materials.txt
            - a list of the items you have vs the list of the items
        -resin_cost.txt
            - a summarry of how many days it will take
